*Locum Clavorum* comes from John 20:25 (His stab wound). I'm proving that this program can work to all the doubting Thomas's who didn't believe me.

A program to earn points in Memrise, a website for language learning. 
I had tons of Spanish homework on this website. I was way ahead of the class, and website wasn't really helping me learn. What it did do was take a long time to complete. When the COVID-19 quarantine started, I decided to dedicate two weeks straight to finish this program. It is very unprofessional and difficult to install, but it worked wonders for me.
It uses pynput to control inputs and scrapes all the information it needs by copying and pasting them to a text file (txt.txt) which must be open before the program starts running.
And for the record, the homework wasn't for a grade, so my moral compass wasn't hurt.
